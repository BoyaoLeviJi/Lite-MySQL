# LiteMySQL
*Simplified commandline Datebase by Levi Ji*

LiteMySQL is a simplified version of the MySQL-inspired project I was inspired to create when I was managing a database for my school's website.

It supports basic functions such as table creation, data insertion, querying, updating and deleting. 

Have fun.
